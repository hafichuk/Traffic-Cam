# City of Calgary Traffic Cam Bookmarklet

The City of Calgary has done a great job at providing an [interactive map](http://www.calgary.ca/Transportation/Roads/Pages/Traffic/Advisories-cl\
osures-and-detours/Calgary-traffic-report.aspx) for road conditions and traffic cameras in and around the city.

This is a simple [Bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) for getting quick access to the images from the traffic cameras.

It opens a new browser window/tab and outputs image tags. There are currently 79 active cameras accessible, though not all produce images all of the time.

In order to keep the javascript simple and not rely on external sources, it outputs invalid html relying on the browser to add `html`, `head` & `body` tags. It's only been tested in Chrome, so if you notice problems in other browsers let me know.

## Installation & Usage

To install the bookmarklet, create a bookmark in your browser then copy in the `trafficcam.min.js` source into the address location.
